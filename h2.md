## h2 - Komentaja Pingviini - Command Line Basics

x) The command line used in Linux -> maybe one of the most valuable tool for a software engineer :)

List of commands:
- pwd (print working directory): prints where I currently am in the file system
- cd (change directory): allows us to change directories (move from one directory to another)
  - cd .. : change directory up
- ls: lists the directory’s contents; Use that if shell says "No such file or directory"
  - ls -a: lists all files and directories
  - ls -l displays the list of files in a long format
- mkdir: make a new directory, create new directories
- rmdir: remove a directory
- nano, pico: text editors
- cp: copy
- rm: remove -> Think before using! Remove the file directly without any trash
- mv: move or rename directory
- -r: recursive
- ssh: (like $ ssh alvar@example.com) open a remote command shell in a very secure way. Opens a remote machine where you can type commands
  exit: exit back to your own machine
  scp: securely copy folder to a folder in remote machine
- man ls: show a manual page of commands
- tab button: guess most of the command -> very useful tool!

- sudo apt-get update: update list of available packages
- sudo apt-get -y install: install software. You can install at same time different softwares only listing them with a space between
- sudo apt-get purge: used to remove the software

a) Installed Micro-editor with typing in the Linux Terminal: $ sudo apt-get -y install micro
